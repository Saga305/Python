****************Python*******************

=> Definition:
	Python is high level, interpreted, interactive, object oriented programming language with automatic memory management and garbage collector.
	Python is dynamically typed and loosely coupled language.

=> Interpreter:
	The interpreter reads program line by line and execute it. Python interpreter is written in C language.
	Python source code runs directly from its source code.

=> Interactive:
	Python can communicate with another language as well as with a user.
		C++/C + Python = CPython or Cython
		Java + Python = Jython

=> Statically coupled language:
	A language in which you must have to specify the data type of variable for memory allocation is called Statically coupled Language.
	Python is dynamically coupled language.

=> Automatic memory management:
	If the values of python variables are same then it allocates a single memory block.

=> Garbage collector:
	It releases unused memory block. It is like a destructor for python.

=> Python data type / data structure:
	Python has two types of data types:
	1. Mutable
	2. Immutable

	=> Mutable data types:
		Mutable data types can change their values, but keep their ID (memory location).

	List of mutable data types:
	1. List
	2. Dictionary
	3. Sets

=> Immutable data types:
	An object with fixed value is called immutable data type.
	Such an object cannot be altered. A new object has to be created if a different value has to be stored.

	List of Immutable data Types:
	1. Number's
	2. String
	3. Tuple
	4. Frozen-sets
